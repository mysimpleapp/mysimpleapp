# MySimpleApp

MySimpleApp is a framework to build Web applications.

It is based on MSA modules, that are server-client modules ready to be used (plug-and-play) without the necessity to write any glue code.

Technically, it is based on [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org)/[ExpressJs](https://expressjs.com) on server side, and on [WebComponents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Components) on client side.
